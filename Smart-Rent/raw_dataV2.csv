Nestled in the picturesque community of Indigo Shores, Middle Sackville, within walking distance to McCabe Lake, this charming 3-bedroom house offers a perfect blend of modern comfort and serene forest living. With almost 3 acres of land and only 20 min to downtown Halifax, this home is a true gem for those seeking a peaceful retreat after a busy day.
The location of the house â in the center of the lot and in a dead-end lane â gives you a lot of privacy. Being only two years old, this house complies with all the recent updates of the building code, including 3â wide doors.
The house is light and bright with 29 good-sized windows and glass doors evenly distributed through its two and a half storeys.
The basement is unfinished. Half of the basement is above grade so it has multiple large windows and a glass door.
The main level is exquisitely decorated with white solid wood cabinets and bookcases. The kitchen features a large deep sink, white shaker-style cabinets and an island. At the entrance, you have a built-in wardrobe and a bathroom hiding additional storage above your washer and dryer set. A multi-purpose room that can be used as an office, an at-home library or a kidâs playroom completes this level. Beautiful hardwood stairs take you to the second level where you can see three generously sized rooms designed to ensure maximum living space in every room. All three rooms and a bathroom are full of built-in linens, white solid wood cabinets, a wardrobe and a walk-in closet to allow adequate storage.
Outside the house, thereâs a very long driveway with a landing to fit multiple vehicles. The property has a lawn area in the backyard and a rustic flowerbed in front of the house.
After a short walk you will find a beautiful 185 sq ft cottage made from premium grade kiln-dried northern spruce with a small cozy woodstove and a large loft that can fit a king-size bed. The roof and the floor are Styrofoam insulated. A large 72 sq ft deck made of 2-inch pressure-treated lumber perfectly completes the cabin.","Parking Included: 3+; Agreement Type: 1 Year; Move-In Date: April 1, 2024; Pet Friendly: Limited; Parking Included: 3+; Utilities Included: Water | Size (sqft): 1,792; Furnished: No; Air Conditioning: Yes; Smoking Permitted: No",House,3,0,1.5,44.7904771,-63.7621176,3+,1,0,"1,792",0,,26776,25705,18680,18551,89,65,80,1602,1689,971,946
